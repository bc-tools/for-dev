Here are the new features.

    1) Templates: the licenses used in a template will be specified in the special file path::``__meta__/about.peuf`` and not in the template structure (this will allow to change, or ignore some licenses dynamically when initiating a new project from one template).

    1) ``gitignore`` rules: all the ¨python names of rules are given in the constant ``ALL_GITIGNORES`` inside the file path::``config/gitignore/gitignore.py``.

    1) Licenses as configuration files (use of special licenses will be also possible).

        * ¨opensource_org and ¨choosealicense are used for the coding oriented licenses: see ref::``https://opensource.org/licenses``.

        * ¨creativecommons_org is used for the "creative" licenses: see ref::``https://creativecommons.org/2014/01/07/plaintext-versions-of-creative-commons-4-0-licenses/``.

    **Useful: see ref::``https://choosealicense.com/`` and ref::``https://creativecommons.org/choose/`` to help you to choose your licenses.**

This project will try to propose a simplified way to init different kinds of coding like projects. Here is the starting feature.

    * ``gitignore`` rules as configuration files: most of the job is done by the website ¨gitignore_io (use of personal rules will be also possible).
