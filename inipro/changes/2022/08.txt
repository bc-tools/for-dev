This project will propose a simplified way to init diffrent kinds of coding like projects. Fot the moment there is only one feature.

    * `gitignore` rules as configuration files: most of the job is done by the website ¨gitignore_io (this makes a dependency to the last version of ¨inipro, but this avoids to always use the web ¨api of ¨gitignore_io, and also to propose very specific rules).
