[[:api:]]
Here are the new features.

    1) Templates: the licenses used in a template will be specified in the special file path::``__meta__/about.peuf`` and not in the template structure (this will allow to change, or ignore some licenses dynamically when initiating a new project from one template).

    1) `gitignore` rules: all the rules are given in the constant ``ALL_GITIGNORES`` inside the file path::``config/gitignore/gitignore.py``.

This project will propose a simplified way to init different kinds of coding like projects. Fot the moment there is only one feature.

    * `gitignore` rules as configuration files: most of the job is done by the website ¨gitignore_io (this makes a dependency to the last version of ¨inipro, but this avoids to always use the web ¨api of ¨gitignore_io, and also to propose very specific rules).
