About `spkpb`
-------------

This module proposes two classes and one function that simplify the writing of programs which have to be verbose about a process on files and directories, and that have to emit informations, warnings and errors.

  1. `Speaker`, the `spk` of `spkpb`, has methods tho print informations on a terminal and/or in a log file.

  1. `Problems`, the `pb` of `spkpb`, allows to indicate and store warnings, "criticals" and errors.

  1. The function `timestamp` adds time stamps in a log file without printing anything in the terminal.


The following tutorial will starts with the hard way to work with the `spkpb` tools and finishes with more programmer-friendly tools.
