**New sub minor version version::``0.0.8-beta``:** here are the useful changes made.

    1) The method ``reset_logfile`` of ``speaker.log.LogSpeaker`` is accessible directly from the classes ``BaseCom``, ``Problems`` and ``Speaker``. 
    
    1) path::``README.md`` has a simpler example of use of ``BaseCom`` and it also talks about the new methods ``reset_logfile``.


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.7-beta``:** here are the little changes made.

    1) The class ``BaseCom`` also allows the use of time stamps. That was omitted. 

    1) path::``README.md`` has been updated with a small example of use of ``BaseCom``.


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.6-beta``:** a class ``BaseCom`` has been added such as to work easily with instances of ``Speaker`` and ``Problems``.

**New sub minor version version::``0.0.5-beta``:** better path::``README.md``.


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.4-beta``:** here are the little changes made.

    1) path::``README.md`` and link added in the path::``pyproject.toml`` for ``poetry``.

    1) Class ``speaker.allinone.Speaker``: ``getter`` and ``setter`` for the boolean attribute ``silent`` (the ``setter`` automatically call the ``forall`` method).

    1) Class ``problems.Problems``: the ``wraps`` decorator from ``functools`` has been removed because it was unuseful.


**First version version::``0.0.3-beta``:** this project proposes tools to simplify the writing of programs which have to be verbose about a process in a terminal and a log file, and that also want to emit warnings and errors (the strange first number version comes from a rigid behavior of Â¨pypi).
