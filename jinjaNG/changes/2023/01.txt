[[:api:]]
Final empty lines: we keep them now (it was a bad idea not to manage them).

:fordev:

[[:test:]]
Testing improved.

    1) ¨cli: the automated tests also compare the content constructed with that expected.

    1) The error messages for the use cases, and the examples in the ¨doc give the absolute path to the folder that revealed an error.


[[:flow:]]
Two small important files added.

    1) Launching all: the ¨bash file path::``launch-all.bash`` launches all builders, and tests to verify that a new version can be delivered (the order of launch is the responsibility of the developer: see the file path::``launch-all-folders.txt``.).

    1) Building the distributed source: the ¨bash file path::``build-project.bash`` does that.

[[:api:]]
Here are the changes made to simplify the ¨api.

    1) Classe ``JNGBuilder``: the boolean parameter/attribut ``pydatas`` has been renamed ``launch_py`` which is more explicit.

    1) The ¨cli ¨api has been simplified, and made more explicit.

        * The parameters term::``--dto`` and term::``--pydto`` no longer exist.

        * The new parameter term::``--unsafe`` indicates clearly that the dangerous use of a ¨python file to build datas is allowed.

        * Each parameter has an abbreviation.

            + term::``-c`` for term::``--cfg``.
            + term::``-f`` for term::``--fl``.
            + term::``-u`` for term::``--unsafe``.

[[:test:]]
Testing the ¨cli.

    1) New debugging file: one ¨bash file to play with the ¨cli.

    1) New test file: one ¨bash file to just check that ¨cli is functional.
