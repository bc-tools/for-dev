¨DSL.

    1) ¨latex: the macro latex::``\JNGVALOF`` can be used inside contents of a latex::``\section`` like title, or inside footnotes.

    1) ¨ascii: only fictive inline comments are used to simplify typing.


[[:doc:]]
path::``README.md``: the ¨tech section about all the flavours has been simplified a lot.


--------
:fordev:

[[:flow:]]
¨DSL - Contribute: the status of flavours have been clarified. It is now possible to update the flavour, without breaking the current ¨src code.

[[:doc:]]
¨Doc: a warning indicates that scripts like ``data.py`` cannot yet do relative imports.


[[:fix:]]
¨Cli: the use of ``--config auto`` was not implemented because internally the value used is ``AUTO_CONFIG = ":auto-config:"``, but not ``"auto"``.

[[:flow:]]
¨Doc: the list of local ¨vars of the method ``JNGBuilder.render`` is automatically constructed.

[[:api:]]
Here are all the new features.

    1) ¨Cfg files, and hooks: it is now possible to work with ¨cfg files which currently only offer the hooks functionality.

    1) ¨CLI: two new things done.

        * An alias allows to use term::``jinjang`` instead of term::``python -m jinjang``.

        * One new option term::``--short``, or term::``-s``, asks to hide the external command output.

    1) Launching external commands: for consistency, a new special ¨var yaml::``{data}`` is available.


[[:doc:]]
path::``README.md``: a new section explains how to use hooks.


-------
:break:
-------

[[:api:]]
Here are all the breaking changes.

    1) The method ``JNGBuilder.render``: the new option ``verbose`` allows to disable the printing of the external command output.

    1) ¨CLI: the optins term::``--flavour`` and term::``--config`` replace the obsolete term::``--fl`` and term::``--cfg``.

    1) All classes, functions, methods... named with "datas" know use "data" without the letter "s".

    1) Launching external commands: the special ¨vars yaml::``{output}`` and yaml::``{template}`` replace the obsolete yaml::``{{output}}`` and yaml::``{{template}}``.


--------
:fordev:
--------

[[:api:]]
Here are the new features.

    1) Contributions: the use cases must propose path::``JSON``, and path::``YAML`` data files. No path::``PY`` data file required.

    1) New file path::``VERSIONS.yaml``: this file lists all dated versions. **In the near future, it will be built automatically.**

    1) New file path::``KEYWORDS.yaml``: the purpose of this file is to easily provide keywords related to the project.

[[:api:]]
Final empty lines: from now, they are kept (it was a bad idea to ignore them).


--------
:fordev:
--------

[[:test:]]
Testing improved.

    1) ¨cli: the automated tests also compare the content constructed with that expected.

    1) The error messages for the use cases, and the examples in the ¨doc give the absolute path to the folder that revealed an error.


[[:flow:]]
Two small important files added.

    1) Launching all: the ¨bash file path::``launch-all.bash`` launches all builders, and tests to verify that a new version can be delivered (the order of launch is the responsibility of the developer: see the file path::``launch-all-folders.txt``.).

    1) Building the distributed source: the ¨bash file path::``build-project.bash`` does that.

[[:api:]]
Here are the changes made to simplify the ¨api.

    1) Classe ``JNGBuilder``: the boolean parameter/attribut ``pydatas`` has been renamed ``launch_py`` which is more explicit.

    1) The ¨cli ¨api has been simplified, and made more explicit.

        * The parameters term::``--dto`` and term::``--pydto`` no longer exist.

        * The new parameter term::``--unsafe`` indicates clearly that the dangerous use of a ¨python file to build data is allowed.

        * Each parameter has an abbreviation.

            + term::``-c`` for term::``--cfg``.
            + term::``-f`` for term::``--fl``.
            + term::``-u`` for term::``--unsafe``.


--------
:fordev:
--------

[[:test:]]
Testing the ¨cli.

    1) New debugging file: one ¨bash file to play with the ¨cli.

    1) New test file: one ¨bash file to just check that ¨cli is functional.
