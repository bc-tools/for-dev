**New sub minor version version::``0.0.10-beta``:** the line ``from pytest import fixture`` was missing... Do not laugh please!


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.9-beta``:** two things have been done.

    1) One fixture added to build and use path::``PEUF`` files very easily. 
    
    1) ``orpystedatas.build_datas`` has been removed (it was wrong and unuseful for the moment).


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.8-beta``:** a very stupid bug fixed in path::``orpystedata.py``.


**First version version::``0.0.7-beta``:** this project is "Common Box of Dev Tools" proposing small scripts that can be helpful (the strange first number version comes from a rigid behavior of Â¨pypi).
