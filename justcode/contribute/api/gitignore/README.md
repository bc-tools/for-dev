Contribute to `gitignore`
=========================

How to contribute?
------------------

Adding new `gitignore` rules is simply a matter of providing a `TXT` file whose name is the identifier of the rules, and whose content is the set of rules.


> The identifier of a rule set can only use unaccented letters, numbers, the hyphen `-`, and the plus sign `+`.
