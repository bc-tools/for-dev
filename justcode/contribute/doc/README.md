How to contribute?
------------------

As the author of `justcode` is a French amateur coder, the documentation is only actively maintained in French. Here is how to translate it.

  1) Start by copying and pasting the `doc` folder where you want to do your translation.

  1) Translate the files without touching the structure used (the writing language used is `tns`, it is very intuitive).

  1) Once the work is well advanced, or even finished, send it to the author of `justcode`.

If you wish to update a translation proposal, you should quickly indicate in English the changes made and date them (no need to go into too much detail).


> The translations made are in the `contribute` folder which has the following structure (the `api` folder is not of interest here).

    dirtree::
        + contribute
            + api [...]
            + doc
                * README.md
                * LICENSE.txt
                + changes
                    * LICENSE.txt
                    * x-todo-x.txt
