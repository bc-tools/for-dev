  name*   : This allows you to give the name of the distributed product
            instead of the name automatically generated from the name of
            the folder containing this YAML file (in some cases, product
            names must follow specific naming rules).
  acronym*: Most names follow hidden schemas that you can explain here.

            a product named is ``myha``.
  desc    : You must always give one small description of your product,
            or monorepo.
