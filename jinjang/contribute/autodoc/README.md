Where are the translations?
---------------------------

The translations made are in the `contribute/autodoc` folder which has the following structure.

<!-- FOLDER STRUCT. AUTO - START -->

    + autdoc
        * LICENSE.txt
        * README.md
        + changes
            * LICENSE.txt
            * x-todo-x.txt

<!-- FOLDER STRUCT. AUTO - END -->


Start a new translation
-----------------------

As the author of `jinjang` is a French amateur coder, the documentation is only actively maintained in French. Here is how to translate it.

  1) Start by copying and pasting the main `doc` folder where you want to do your translation.

  1) Translate the files without touching the structure used (the writing language used is `tns`, it is very intuitive).

  1) Placeholders are used to be filled automatically. They are all named using the syntax `<: NAME_OF_ONE_PLACEHOLDER :>`. This placeholder doesn't need to be translated; their english names should make easy to guess the final content that will be used.

  1) Once the work is well advanced, or even finished, send it to the author of `jinjang`.
