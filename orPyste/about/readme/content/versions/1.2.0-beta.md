There are some important changes in this version.

1. The mode ``multikeyval``, for repeatable keys in the same block, has been totally implemented.

1. You can now use a context manager with the classes ``Read``, ``ReadBlock`` and ``Clean``. By using ``with ... as ...:``, you let the package calls for you the methods ``build`` and ``remove_extras`` *(this last method had name ``remove`` before)*.

1. The class ``ReadBlock`` no longer has the methods ``flatdict`` and ``recudict``. Instead, it has two properties ``flatdict`` and ``treedict`` that allow to work with ``dict`` like variables. For customized dictionaries, you can use the new method ``mydict``.

1. The old method ``rtu_datas`` of the class ``Infos`` has been replaced by the property ``rtu`` which outputs are easier to "understand", and there is also an iterator ``yrtu`` to work with the "same" kind of datas with the classes ``Read`` and ``ReadBlock``.
