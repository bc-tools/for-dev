warning::
    So as to do more cycling, from now the author will just write an english log with all the details (maybe the author will improve his english by this way).


**Somme bugs corrected in ``parse.ast`` :** here are the dirty bugs that have been exterminated.

    1) When titles of sections was indented, they remain titles of sections. That was not wanted ! This bug killed, we retreive the fact that comments can't be indented.
    All of this needed to refactor the method ``ast.AST.manage_indent`` which is now just used by ``ast.AST.search_ctxts``.

    2) One comment over several lines at the end of one block disallow the closing of the block.


**Improvements and correction of bugs in the module ``data`` :** here is what has been done.

    1) The "querypaths" using sections was bad defined. Indeed this feature was never tested ! Because hooks ``[...]`` are meaningful in Python regexes, we use instead ``<...>`` to indicate one section in the "querypaths".

    2) The class ``data.Infos`` does no longer use lists for storing informations. We prefer tuples. At the same time, the method ``rtu`` has been cleaned.

    3) The codes of the methods ``flatdict`` and ``_builddict`` of the class ``data.ReadBlock`` has been cleaned.


**Improvements and correction of bugs in the module ``clean`` :** here is what has been done (even if it remains to manage user's settings for spaces).

    1) Real management of sections.

    2) Correction of one big bug : if one comment was just before one block at the begining of the Â¨peuf file then it was printed inside the block and not before.


**New tests :** here are the new features monitored.

    1) The sections.

    2) Searching with "querypaths".


**Change of version :** we go to the version version::``1.3.1-beta`` because of "new-old" behavior of comments, and also because of the new specification for sections inside the "querypaths" (see indications above).
