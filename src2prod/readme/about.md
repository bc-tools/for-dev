About `src2prod`
----------------

This module allows to develop a project within a source folder and to publish the final product in another folder, this last directory being a "thin" version of the source one. If you use `git`, this module can talk with it to do a better job.

> We give detailed examples using `Python`, and then this document ends with an explanation of how to use `python -m src2prod` in a terminal.
