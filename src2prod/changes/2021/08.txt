**New sub minor version version::``0.0.2-beta``:** three important things done.

    1) The module ``lowlevel`` and ``LowLevel`` the class have been renamed ``baseproj`` and ``BaseProj``.

    1) A stupid bug fixed: the default value of ``readme`` when instanciating ``baseproj.BaseProj`` was ``False`` instead of ``None``.
    
    1) ``README.md``: the use of relative paths has been indicated.

**New sub minor version version::``0.0.1-beta``:** an external ``README`` can be used.
