**New sub minor version version::``0.0.5-beta``:** indeed terminal::``poetry run src2prod`` does not work... 


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.4-beta``:** the ¨cli can be launched via terminal::``poetry run src2prod``.


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.3-beta``:** here are the changes made.

    1) One ¨cli has been added to update projects.
    
    1) Attribut ``ignore``: it can be either a string or an absolute ``pathib.Path`` of a file containing the rules (that feature is necessary for the ¨cli but it is also useful in a none ¨cli context)
    
    1) ``README.md``: the syntax for ``ignore`` rules has been explained and ¨infos about the new ¨cli features have been added.            


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.2-beta``:** three important things done.

    1) The module ``lowlevel`` and the class ``LowLevel`` have been renamed ``baseproj`` and ``BaseProj``.

    1) ``baseproj.BaseProj`` previously ``lowlevel.LowLevel``: one stupid bug fixed. Instantiation used the default value ``False`` instead of ``None`` for the argument ``readme``.

    1) ``README.md``: the use of relative paths has been indicated.


**New sub minor version version::``0.0.1-beta``:** an external ``README`` can be used.
