Without the special `about.yaml` file
-------------------------------------

Without an `about.yaml` file, all the `MD` files will be merged into one after sorting them in a "natural" order.


> ***WARNING!*** *Without an `about.yaml` file, it is impossible to work with subfolders containing `MD` files.*
