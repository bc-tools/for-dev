[[:fix:]]
Bug in ``toc.TOC._extract_recu``: the test used to handle subfolders was broken because ``Path`` instances from the automatic search were not converted to strings.

What a mess! Using prefixes was a very bad good idea.

    1) path::``toc.py`` and ``TOC`` are coming back and steal the show from path::``mmdtoc.py`` and ``MMDTOC``.

    1) path::``build.py`` and ``Builder`` make also their coming back, and kill path::``mmdbuild.py`` and ``MMDBuilder``.
